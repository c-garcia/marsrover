# marsrover kata in clojure

Just a first execution of the [Mars Rover Kata](http://craftsmanship.sv.cmu.edu/katas/mars-rover-kata) in
[clojure](http://www.clojure.org). It has been useful to practice a little bit:

 * TDD
 * [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org)
 * [Speclj](http://speclj.com)

Probably, I should address it a couple of more times to make it into the muscle memory.
